      The high potency of fentanyl greatly increases risk of overdose,
      especially if a person who uses drugs is unaware that a powder or pill

      resulting in overdose.

      Fentanyl works by binding to the body's opioid receptors, which are found
      in areas of the brain that control pain and emotions. Its effects include
      extreme happiness, drowsiness, nausea, confusion, constipation, sedation,
      tolerance, addiction, respiratory depression and arrest, unconsciousness,
