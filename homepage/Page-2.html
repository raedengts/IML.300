      <h1>Reading #1</h1>
      Jenny Odell brings to light the fact that we as humans like to use what's
      familiar to us and find a commonality between that and what is new. She
      describes the origins of the internet and the ways it was marketed to the
      public as a newly developed version of what already existed (maps, mail,
      paper, and pen) I feel that this leaves the mind somewhat constrained in
      what we can imagine because we feel it needs to somehow have a similarity
      to something we already know. Additionally, the huge movement of how-to
      videos suggests that we as a culture are wanting to learn more, we want to
      be independent and know things for ourselves rather than rely on someone
      to do them for us or directly teach us in our lives. This may lead to a
      sort of feeling of isolation or not needing to interact in person because
      you can find everything you need to know on the internet. As the internet
      evolved it became more apparent that corporate America was jumping on the
      opportunity to use young and money-hungry kids to get their message
      through to the new generation. This was the beginning of influencer
      marketing and a huge cultural shift of disguising ads as personal advice,
      and banking on the personal engagement that these people have earned
      initially based solely on their humanity. Odell expresses how the
      randomness of the internet is taken away, which leads to a multitude of
      different bubbles that seem so familiar to us and exclude anything
      different from our past preferences. This limits the encounters with
      difference, and results in an echo chamber or running around in circles of
      only your familiarities. This contributes to a more divided culture in
      which we are comfortable, and don't seek information that contradicts or
      doesn’t even relate to what is in our bubble. This takes the spontaneity
      out of the internet and constrains our minds into a predisposed box that
      is decided by our past interests, not our future ones. I learned that the
      internet and fast-paced setting makes it easy to not acknowledge anything
      that makes you uncomfortable, you can simply click out of it, you are not
      forced to sit with it like how Odell was in the dining car of the train in
      which she needed to have a conversation with people incredibly different
      from her. A great takeaway from this article is “we find what we want, and
      what we want finds us.” I think that this encompasses both the positive
      and negative aspects of the internet and its possibilities. Laurel
      Schwulst discusses the intricacies of what a website really is. Not only
      the coding and structural aspects of a website but specifically the
      emotional and human characteristics of a website and how we can use
      websites to create new worlds. She remarks that a “website is an
      individual act of collective ambition.” It is clear that the main argument
      Schwulst is making is that websites should be ever-changing, they should
      grow and develop along with us as humans, and be a tool for creating
      portals and possibilities rather than advertisement by corporations. Molly
      Soda’s work lends itself to early 2000s nostalgia. She is both critical
      and embraces the internet, stating that it does cause her many problems.
      However, for her, it was a space that she could feel included, heard, and
      seen as a Puerto Rican girl growing up in Indiana. The internet for her
      was a new world and a world that she could mostly control but then became
      extremely encapsulating. Discussion Questions: Is there a way for the
      internet to return to the randomness that was its beginnings? If so, would
      human culture be willing to make that transition? How can we expose
      ourselves to information that is outside of our internet bubble
      sustainably, and what could be done to make this more effortless? What
      damage, if any, do targeted advertisements and commercialized websites
      have on mental creativity?

    Archive the Internet The simple act of archiving proves to be an immensely
    powerful way to not only document current narratives but to resist future,
    present, and past ones. As media has grown away from print and physical
    papers, digital archives have never been more important. Lara Baladi
    explores how the rise of technology and the digital age somewhat fueled the
    revolution in Egypt by providing the Egyptian citizens with a look into the
    world outside of Egypt. She states, "The number of online platforms, their
    direct influence on the ground, and the role of online communities became
    more significant." The ability to see into other communities and their
    current situations can ignite dissatisfaction and provide insight into what
    your current situation is not providing for you. I think that the act of
    archiving is an accessible way to resist and revolutionize and is especially
    important for younger generations to take part in. Paul Soulellis Touches on
    gay shame, urgency and activism, and rising movements using extremely urgent
    art to convey the importance and gain traction for their movement. Artists
    and designers creating a whole new visual language to express this crisis.
    ACT UP organization against aids - used a lot of interesting graphic design
    elements to make their posters and gain attention. He created the printed
    web, using it to freeze moments in time, such as Trump's inauguration, all
    content related to historically marginalized people had disappeared. An
    active erasure, he republished the information in print- left hand = Obama
    content right page = trump's "thank you for your interest in this subject"
    message. Bernie Sanders brought the large printed tweets to the senate
    floor. They are using Public materiality as one way to slow down the
    narrative, taking things out of the web archives and putting them into
    physical space. Urgentcraft is a media movement that aims to make a
    difference in the physical world. Discussion questions: what is one example
    of Urgentcraft that you have seen in your life? How could media potentially
    harm revolutions and political uprisings? Why is Urgentcraft important in
    today's world? And how could it have made a difference in history if it was
    more widely used?

    <h1>Reading #3</h1>
    I find it very interesting that the start of almost any new field is not
    deemed lucrative or worthy enough for men to invest in. Until the moment
    that women start benefitting and making money doing something, the men want
    nothing to do with it. I think that this is unfortunate because it often
    results in women's impacts being erased from history especially in fields
    that are now male-dominated such as computer science and technology.
    However, it does not surprise me that women were at the forefront of the
    movement of the computer because, quite frankly, women are always at the
    forefront of major change, they just don't get recognized for it. Computers
    and the internet can serve as a playing field leveler, but the programming
    and who decides what is on the internet and who owns it can exacerbate
    inequalities if it is not kept in check. I think that the possibilities of
    the internet are endless and I hope that the world continues to be able to
    use it to make important social changes. Black Gooey Universe explores the
    innate erasure of blackness from online graphical interfaces solely due to
    their implementation by whiteness. It is something that may not be
    noticeable at first glance, but American Artist does a great job of
    emphasizing the realities of graphical interfaces. They state, “Users of
    computer technology now encompass a general populace rather than just
    colleagues and fellow white male nerds1, but the industry is still white.”
    This sums up their argument well by addressing how black people were left
    out at the beginning of computer technology and therefore their spaces on
    the internet are inherently white, and blackness is erased. Rich User
    Experience, UX and Desktopization of War by Olia Lialina examines the
    history, present, and future of user experience as a concept and practice.
    She emphasizes the importance of fully understanding UX as a tool to
    understand those around us, and possibly transform or save the future of the
    web. Lialina explains that “Experience designers should not provide
    experiences for gun sights. There should be no user illusion and no illusion
    of being a user created for military operations. The desktopization of war
    shouldn’t happen.” She brings an important perspective to the future of AR
    and VR and how it could potentially be abused by the wrong people, and
    perpetuate the harm of wartime especially for people with PTSD. However, it
    can also be used to treat/ cure PTSD. Discussion Questions: How can we as
    designers actively work against black erasure in graphical interfaces? What
    is one way that VR and AR could be used to solve a problem close to your
    heart? Who should get to decide what is allowed and prohibited in the world
    of VR and AR creation?

    All of the readings and videos this week explored surveillance and its
    deeply complex issues and benefits. DNA found on discarded cigarettes and
    gum can provide enough information to make a very realistic sketch of the
    person to who it belongs. Information such as eye color, hair color, sex,
    ethnicity, and height can be found and replicated to create 3D printed faces
    that look tremendously real. Additionally, the concept of surveillance has
    been proven to be sought after or wanted by members of society, and Lauren
    describes that the comfort and needs of humans from their surveillance
    technologies vary greatly. For example, some want to feel like they are
    being seen, or that someone cares about them, whereas others want someone to
    completely control their light switches, locks, and faucets. Some people
    want to be surveillance and “cared for”, others want to be “invisible”, and
    others have no choice or say in their own surveillance. While reading about
    how black women have historically not had a say in their own surveillance
    and extreme trauma has been caused as a result of this It got me thinking
    about slavery, chain gangs, and mass incarceration. There is
    disproportionately more African American men and women incarcerated in the
    united states than their white counterparts for similar,if not less violent,
    offenses. With institutions and especially carceral institutions comes
    excessive surveillance, lack of privacy, and lack of rights. It would be
    interesting to explore the direct relationship between these effects of
    institutionalized surveillance and day-to-day surveillance systems like
    Alexa. Discussion questions: How can we use surveillance technology to right
    the wrongs it has caused ? In what ways are certain groups of people more
    vulnerable to surveillance abuse than others? Is being invisible the
    solution to privacy issues? Raeden Tapia-Stevens — 10/05/2021 In Xiao Mina’s
    talk when defining a meme the definition that stood out to me the most was
    from Amanda Brennan- she defines a meme as “Pieces of content that travel
    from person to person and change along the way.” I think that this
    encompasses the literal and theoretical meaning of a meme in that it is
    ever-changing, made by people, and unpredictable. Every time we see a meme
    that makes us laugh, it’s likely because we have never seen it before, if a
    friend shows us a meme and we have seen it before our immediate response Is
    usually “yeah I’ve seen that already” basically meaning “it is not funny
    anymore” the sense of joy, newness, and laugh provoking content that travels
    to and from people on the internet is reliant on its originality.
    Additionally, the conversation about censorship and its innate
    acknowledgment of the social and political power of the arts is
    enlightening. I have never thought about the extreme threat to standing
    political powers that art and the internet have especially meme culture.
    Memes aim to send a message and sometimes a laugh about very serious issues.
    Iterations and remixes of art and messages have made serious issues more
    accessible in my opinion to younger generations or to people with no special
    interest in the topic. I think that making memes and circulating them is a
    good way to gain acknowledgment of an issue without extremely dangerous
    consequences. Raeden Tapia-Stevens — 10/05/2021 “Focus is identified as a
    class position, a position of ease and privilege, while being out of focus
    lowers one’s value as an image.” - a poor image and both literal and
    figurative consequences of being out of focus have never crossed my mind
    before. I was very interested in this idea of not showing poor images of
    people or events that deserve clear, rich, focus. I think that blurred,
    out-of-focus, low-quality images automatically render the subjects as less
    than a higher quality image, it paints their lives, pains, and joys as
    unworthy or unable to be captured in a “rich” way. I think it would be very
    interesting to flip this narrative and photograph traditionally politically
    powerful individuals in a low-quality “poor image” way and see if it renders
    any reactions. This method could be used again to photograph traditionally
    precarious situations in extreme detail, therefore placing them in “rich”
    light, garnering more attention and action for them. Rose Menkman examines
    the importance of glitch as a tool to disrupt the strive for uninterrupted
    perfection on the internet. They state that “The glitch is a wonderful
    experience of an interruption that shifts an object away from its ordinary
    form and discourse. “ and explains that Glitch art is a style that Bends and
    twists things until they break, and create something entirely new. If
    nothing is ever changed or broken, disrupted or questions, there will be no
    real freedom or ability for change on the internet and in the art world. It
    is important to not fall into a cycle of treating the internet as a place
    where there cannot be disruptions, mistakes, cracks, and breaks, because
    that is what makes it alive and reflective of human life. Discussion
    questions: is there a way for glitch art to be incorporated into mainstream
    media? in what ways could memes be dangerous? Historically, can you think of
    a time when focus and poor images had real-world consequences, and how can
    we make sure that this changes in today's world?

    Joy Buolamwini brings to light an extremely disturbing but common issue in
    facial recognition software. Her face was continuously not being recognized
    by facial recognition software, and only recognizing her face when she was
    wearing a white mask. This obviously is a problem in itself, but its
    consequences can extend to extremely serious and destructive when used in
    predictive policing or criminal sentencing scenarios. Joy started the
    algorithmic justice league online community to fight against the #codedgaze
    and is working to rally fighters who are also against unfairness to
    hopefully change these software and their uses to make them less biased.
    Raeden Tapia-Stevens — 10/12/2021 Mimi Onuoha generated a database of people
    who catcalled her over one summer. The main importance was how this data set
    was generated. She had to walk up to these men and felt somewhat unsafe or
    in a hostile environment. The way that the data is collected is almost more
    important than the data itself. The varying visualizations of data
    collection and its process and how it implies a sort of relationship between
    the collector and the person whose data is being collected. There are some
    things that will not fit patterns of past data collection, but it is
    important to give equal thought to the collection process as the collected
    material. Raeden Tapia-Stevens — 10/12/2021 Afro-now-ism by Stephanie
    Dinkins was a somewhat dense read for me. I felt that every sentence could
    be a stand-alone powerful quote so it was hard to extract only a few
    specific things. One of my favorite quotes was “people who threaten the
    comfort of those benefiting from institutional power are expendable.” She
    talks about how AI is going to be integrated into our society whether we
    like it or not, but it could be used as a tool to further equity and
    inclusion of different marginalized communities along with those who are
    wealthier or traditionally benefit from our social systems. I think that
    this is an important take and a crucial part of investigating the future and
    possible symbiotic relationship that humans are going to inevitably have
    with nature and machines. Discussion Questions: What is a database that
    doesn't exist now but should exist to bring light to an inequity, how would
    it be collected and used? is AI more likely to be a tool of good, or
    exacerbate inequalities that we are currently working to fix? does the work
    of programmers and software engineers have more influence in our society's
    future than say political leaders or traditional influcences?

    Morehshin Allhyari’s Eyeo talk referenced ways in which art and media can
    disrupt currents systems of power and oppression, as well as digital
    colonialism and re-figuring. She focused a lot on the Middle East and Iran,
    specifically the occupation of the country by extremist groups. I learned
    that simply making stories visible to the rest of the world, stories that
    aren’t being heard or told, can make an enormous impact on how we view,
    associate, and interact with people and places different from what we are
    familiar with. Olivia Ross offers a great concise list of ways to create
    non-violent code. Her main points were to Honor the land, Honor the body,
    Honor the small, honor the people, and honor the exchange. One point that I
    had never thought of before was to honor the small. She states, “Can you
    produce or share work on a large platform (Twitter, Instagram, etc), without
    doing work for that platform? How can you decouple your online practice from
    tech giants?.” Thinking about this is very interesting and important and I
    will try to incorporate this into my creative process as I think it should
    be more widely thought about. Yaa Addae explores digital racism, data
    trauma, and digital doulas in a captivating way. One quote that stood out to
    me from Olivia Ross says “E-Capitalism has taken movements and watered them
    down because once you label something, you limit what it can become.
    Predictive analysis limits our human potential for growth.” drops mic The
    fact that such a large percentage of our society is on the internet yet a
    very small percentage controls what is on it, the data they collect, and the
    algorithms that make content and data visible to users is grounds for
    injustices and racial biases that may not even be intentional. I think that
    the idea of digital doulas, people whose work aims to help people develop a
    positive relationship with technology, have huge potential to be influential
    in our generation, and deserve more traction and exposure. discussion
    questions: which of Olivia Ross' points on how to create non-violent code
    was new to you? Do you think digital doulas can make a difference in the
    internet communities? if so, how can we contribute to expanding their reach?

    Ari Melenciano discusses, in Omni-Specialized design for beautiful futures,
    the importance of creating “with” not “for” communities, especially
    communities of color. She also talks about how everyone, not just white
    people, need to be conscious about involving and creating with people and
    not ever entering into a community with the intent to fix, but only with an
    intent to work together. I liked learning about circular design (designing
    without waste), and respectful design (understanding how design can have any
    different meanings to different groups of people and you need to be cautious
    of all of these meanings and respectful of them). One big takeaway that Ari
    provides is that we have to move from being reactionary to visionary, and
    from yearning for instant gratification to sustainability. Hamid Khan is an
    activist focused on stopping the LAPD’s spying efforts on marginalized
    communities and addtitionally predictive policing with his organization
    “Stop LAPD Spying Coalition”. He states “We are fiercely an abolitionist
    group, so our goal is to dismantle the system” and when asked about reform
    he says he does not believe in reform, doesn’t think it will work, and is
    purely an abolitionist. Surveillance efforts have been made by the
    government for years and historically targeted marginalized communities such
    as African Americans and slaves that were required by “lantern laws” to
    physically carry a lantern when walking around after dark without their
    master. The mode of surveillance has changed with technology but the motive
    of it hasn’t. Algorithms do not belong in surveillance systems because they
    are inherently biased. Active efforts must be made to stop surveillance
    systems of oppression and mend their damage with education of these systems
    for the communities involved. Discussion Questions: How can we make sure
    that information and learning opportunities like Ari's teaching programs
    reach a broad audience? In what ways do the LAPD's spying efforts make you
    feel safe, or unsafe?
